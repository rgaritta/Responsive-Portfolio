            <p class="text"> My name is Rick Garitta. I started coding back in high school but I like to joke that music "derailed" my life
                and I have been working in the entertainment industry for the past six years. Although I have enjoyed it
                and have got to work with many arists including those who I look up to, it is time for a career change. </p>
            <p class="text"> I currently play bass guitar in a band called
                <a target="_blank" href="http://traverser.band">Traverser</a>. Music has been a major part of my life for as long as I can remember and there are a lot of
                parallels between being a musician and coding. </p>
            <p class="text">I have learned over the course of my life that work is typically more rewarding when it is something that you
                are interested in. To me coding is one of the few professions that allows you to be creative while adhering
                to the rules of a strict framework. This can almost be easier than either being not bounded by any rules,
                such as writing music or painting, or having to adhere too closely to a set of rules, such as accounting.
